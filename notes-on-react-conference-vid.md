# React-Native Conference Notes

In developing for mobile, we want the best parts from native and we want the best parts from web.

In native:
The user experience is better
Touch handling is better
We get nice native components 
Improved performance

But the developer experience is bad
Different platforms in different 


Setting the views is the only thing dones on the main thread
All the layout is done in a different thread
At the end of the diff algorithm and react logic, everything is flushed to the main thread

How is it running
We are not transpriling JS to Objective C 
We are running a real JS engine

We can run our app in chrome to get access to dev tools

We can server side render native apps!?

CSS is written in JS

A load of stuff is sorted by writing CSS in JS.
